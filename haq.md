# Hypothetically Asked Questions

## Q: "...Oh, another debunker website?"

  The main goal of this website is to present the arguments of various Alternative History theories in the best light possible, gather the evidence, links to literature, and other related resources but also discuss the counter-arguments and let the reader form his own opinion.

  The information provided on this website should be ideally useful for both adherents and skeptics.

  We're not in the business of "converting someone" to one belief or another.  We all believe in something.  But it doesn't hurt from time to time to think about **why** we believe what we believe, and whether it's not possible that we might have been misled by someone else's interpretations.

## Q: "If you don't believe in it, why even bother?"

  *We Want To Believeâ„¢*.  That's why we dedicate out time to research.  Also, we feel that some of the theories are so interesting that the way they're presented in the fringe circles is actually doing them a disservice.

## Q: "What makes you an expert?"

  Absolutely nothing.  Which is the exact reason why we avoid making any original claims and when any speculations are offered, they're clearly noted as such.

## Q: "Isn't all this stuff on Wikipedia already?"

  Despite the popular belief that "anybody can edit Wikipedia", most of the *ad-hoc* changes are later reverted, and the preferred way of contribution by raising the discussion on Talk pages can sometime take months to progress.

  Moreover, the prospect of altering the most controversial entries, which are the main focus of this website, is even slimmer.
