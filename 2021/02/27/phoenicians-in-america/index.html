  <h1 class="post-title">Phoenicians in America</h1>
  <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2021</span>
  <p>The theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas suggests that the earliest Old World contact with the Americas was not with Columbus or even Norse settlers, but with the Phoenicians (or, alternatively, other Semitic peoples).</p>

<p>Sadly, this theory fell quickly into the fringe territory because quite a few of artifacts speaking in it’s favor are considered to be hoaxes.</p>

<h3 id="dighton-rock">Dighton Rock</h3>

<p>The first reference to the carvings on the Dighton Rock dates back to 1680, when recent Harvard graduate John Danforth spotted the rock in what was then the town of Dighton and made a drawing of its carvings.</p>

<h3 id="the-paraíba-stone">The Paraíba Stone</h3>

<p>So, we have a letter with a transcription of inscriptions found on a stone, that was never actually seen by scientists, it was posted from an unknown place on an ambiguous river by a person who could not be found later. It’s text was, according to some scholars badly written and therefore a hoax, but, according to others, genuine.</p>

<h3 id="diodoros-of-sicily">Diodoros of Sicily</h3>

<p>Diodoros’ <em>Library of History</em> is remarkable for many reasons. This 40-volume book (of which only 15 books surive intact) is considered one of the earliest attempts at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_history">Universal history</a> and also it is notably more detached from ‘Hellenocentric’ world-view<sup id="fnref:usher" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:usher" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.  It’s also a major source of our knowledge about Alexander the Great!</p>

<p>That being said, some passages are a bit controversial.  For fans of Alternative History, he’s mainly notable for his mentions of Atlantis, but it also contains this peculiar passage story about Phoenicians:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now that we have discussed what relates to the islands which lie within the Pillars of Hercules, we shall give an account of those which are in the ocean. For there lies out in the deep off Libya an island of considerable size, and situated as it is in the ocean it is distant from Libya a voyage of a number of days to the west.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its land is fruitful, much of it being mountainous and not a little being a level plain of surpassing beauty. Through it flow navigable rivers which are used for irrigation, and the island contains many parks planted with trees of every variety and gardens in great multitudes which are traversed by streams of sweet water;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>on it also are private villas of costly construction, and throughout the gardens banqueting houses have been constructed in a setting of flowers, and in them the inhabitants pass their time during the summer season, since the land supplies in abundance everything which contributes to enjoyment and luxury.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] the climate of this island is so altogether mild that it produces in abundance the fruits of the trees and the other seasonal fruits for the larger part of the year, so that it would appear that the island, because of its exceptional felicity, were a dwelling-place of a race of gods and not of men.(V-19)<sup id="fnref:diodoros" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diodoros" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In ancient times this island remained undiscovered because of its distance from the entire inhabited world j but it was discover ed at a later period for the following reason.  The Phoenicians, who from ancient times on made voyages continually for purposes of trade, planted many colonies throughout Libya and not a few as well in the western parts of Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And since their ventures turned out according to their expectations, they amassed great wealth and essayed to voyage beyond the Pillars of Heracles into the sea which men call the ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] The Phoenicians, then, while exploring the coast outside the Pillars for the reasons we have stated and while sailing along the shore of Libya, were driven by strong winds a great distance out into the ocean. And after being storm-tossed for many days they were carried ashore on the island we mentioned above, and when they had observed its felicity and nature they caused it to be known to all men.(V-20)<sup id="fnref:diodoros:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diodoros" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we are said that Tyrrhenians wanted to make a colony there, but Carthaginians prevented it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] partly out of concern lest many inhabitants of Carthage should remove there because of the excellence of the island, and partly in order to have ready in it a place in which to seek refuge against an incalculable turn of fortune, in case some total disaster should overtake Carthage.  For it was their thought that, since they were masters of the sea, they would thus be able to move, households and all, to an island which was unknown to their conquerors.</p>
</blockquote>
