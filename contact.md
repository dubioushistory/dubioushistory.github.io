# Contact us!

  This website is built on a collaborative platform [GitHub](https://github.com/dubioushistory/dubioushistory.github.io).  If you have any suggestions or contributions, the preferable way to voice them is through the *Issues*, *Pull Requests* or *Discussions* tabs in the link above.  We are always thrilled for any suggestions or opinions!

  If you don't feel like creating an account on GitHub, you can also use plain old e-mail to contact us.  Either using the form below or write [directly to our address](mailto://historicaldoubts@gmail.com) through your mail client.

  Also, each article offers discussion forum provided by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), which allows to login via your Google, Facebook, or Twitter account.

  If that still feels too personal to you, each post also links to a discussion on Reddit.  However, keep in mind that Reddit automatically locks threads after 6 months since their posting.
