  <h1 class="post-title">Dighton Rock</h1>
  <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2021</span>
  <p>The Dighton Rock, crystaline sandstone boulder found in the riverbed of the Taunton River in current Berkley, Massachsetts, bears petroglyphs which are still controversial to this day.  This artefact is remarkable mainly for how long it is has been generating range of very diverse speculations.</p>

<p>The first reference to the carvings on the Dighton Rock dates back to 1680, shortly after the suppression of rebellion of Wampanoag Indians, when recent Harvard graduate John Danforth spotted the rock in what was then the town of Dighton and made a drawing of its carvings.<sup id="fnref:inscriptions" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inscriptions" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A book <em>The Wonderful Works of God Commemorated</em> by Cotton Mather from 1690 makes a reference to the rock:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among the other Curiosities of New-England, one is that of a mighty Rock, on a perpendicular side whereof by a River, which at High Tide covers part of it, there are very deeply Engraved, no man alive knows How or When about half a score Lines, near Ten Foot Long, and a foot and half broad, filled with strange Characters: which would suggest as odd Thoughts about them that were here before us, as there are odd Shapes in that Elaborate Monument.<sup id="fnref:mather" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mather" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, because no organic pigment or no other related artefacts have been found in the area, there’s no way of scientifically dating when the inscriptions were made.  But there don’t seem to be any doubts about it’s antiquity.</p>

<h2 id="theories-of-origin">Theories of origin</h2>

<p>Despite a few hundred years of speculation, the extensive petroglyphs on the rock have still raise controversy. The most widely held hypothesis attributes them to Native Americans.  However, it was attributed also to Norse Vikings, Portuguese, Phoenicians, Chinese and more.</p>

<p>In 1767, Ezra Stiles, then president of Yale University, declared in his <em>Election Sermon</em> that the figures on the rock were of Phoenician origin.  Stiles writes that a copy of inscription was sent to M. Gebelin of the Parisian academy of sciences, who comparing them with the Punic paleography, judges them punic, and has interpreted them as denoting, that the ancient Carthaginians once visited these distant regions.<sup id="fnref:stiles" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stiles" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Side-note:</em> George Washington, while shown the Sewell’s transcription in Harvard College in 1789, allegedly scoffed at then-prevailing Phoenician thoery. He remarked that he encountered many similar markings on his travels in Virginia.<sup id="fnref:washington" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:washington" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The controversy was reignited when Danish writer Charles Christian Rafn published his <em>Antiquities Americanae</em> in 1837, which contained more than 40 pages of analysis of the Dighton Rock. Rafn concluded the markings on the rock were Norse.  His translation says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thorfinn and his 151 companions took possession of this land.<sup id="fnref:rafn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rafn" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1912, Edmund B. Delabarre announced his discovery of date “1511” and the name of “Miguel Corte-Real,” a Portuguese explorer who had left Portugal in 1502 and never returned.  Fifty years after, Manuel Da Silva made a study of the rock and came upon two other clues, the Portuguese royal coat-of-arms and the Portuguese Cross of the Order of Christ. He published his findings in his <em>Portuguese Pilgrims and Dighton Rock</em> in 1971. Delabarre proposed that he had been heard from, in the inscription on the rock that read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MIGUEL CORTEREAL – V. DEI HIC DUX IND – 1511 <sup id="fnref:delabarre" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:delabarre" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>More recent proponents of the Portuguese theory include Manuel Luciano da Silva and Geroge F. W. Young<sup id="fnref:young" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:young" class="footnote">7</a></sup>.  Notable historian of Portuguese discoveries, Luís de Albuquerque, discarded the theory in his <em>Navegadores, Viajantes e Aventureiros Portugueses (1987)</em>.  More recently, popular literature writer Douglas Hunter provides thorough analysis, debunking the Corte-Real origin myth.<sup id="fnref:hunter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hunter" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the most recent theories came in 2002. Gavin Menzies, in his book <em>1421: The Year China Discovered America</em>, proposed that the inscriptions we made by Chinese explorers who had arrived and claimed the Americas for themselves at that time.<sup id="fnref:menzies" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:menzies" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Needless to say, that the historians of Dighton Rock Museum hold that it’s made by native Americans.  The museum recently acquired high-resolution 3D scan of the object, giving them access to the smallest details and angles.<sup id="fnref:berkland" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:berkland" class="footnote">10</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:hunter:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hunter" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Best description of the Rorschach test-like effect the rock has on people was fittingly summarized by E. B. Delabarre himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is easy to imagine as present on the rock almost any desired letter of the alphabet, especially of crude of early forms; and that, starting with almost any favored story, he can discover for it, if he looks for them eagerly enough, illustrative images to fit its various features, and initial letters or even entire words or names.<sup id="fnref:delabarre2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:delabarre2" class="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
