</ul><p>Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant who traveled across Asia at the end of the 13th century, is deeply ingrained in our history.  He became synonymous with traveling and adventure, countless brands and companies bear his name, and his story continues to inspire movies, books, and video games.</p>

<p>He definitely wasn’t the first European who reached China, but his book surpassed all other records both in the scope and the popularity.  But right from the start, his book was met with large skepticism and it raised many controversies, some of which continue to this day.</p>

<p>The book was actually written by a romance writer Rustichello da Pis as a collection of Polo’s memories, which he relayed to him while they were allegedly imprisoned together during the Venetian-Genoese wars.</p>

<p>There is very little written about the life of Marco outside of travels.  All that we learn about his family are the names of his father Niccolò and uncle Maffeo, and that they sailed away before Marco’s birth and returned to Venice in 1269 when he was fifteen years old. [Preface, Chapter 9]<sup id="fnref:yule" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yule" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="historical-record">
<a class="anchor" href="#historical-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Historical record</h2>

<p>Let’s start by stating the fact, that most scholars believe that Polo was a real person.  His name is mentioned in many contemporary Italian documents, genealogies, and even legal proceedings from which we can learn more about his family and life.  His last will was found, as well as wills of his two uncles, which provide some additional information too, most famously the notion of freeing a Tartar servant called Peter from his service. [Appendix 3]<sup id="fnref:yule:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yule" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>None of these documents, however, mention anything about his travels or China at all.</p>

<p>Marco Polo was likely born in Venice, although there is no proof of his place of birth, around 1254 CE.  The theory that he was born on the island of Korčula in today’s Croatia remains highly controversial, however, he is still connected to Korčula, as it is considered the place where he was taken a prisoner by Genoese.</p>

<p>The first author who attempted to piece together some facts about his life was Venetian geographer Giovanni Battista Ramusio in the 16th century.  Though he himself most likely traveled a little, his <em>Navigation and Travels</em> was an important resource documenting, discussing, and comparing journeys of famous explorers like Polo, Magellan, Niccolò de’ Conti, and others.</p>

<p>Ramusio’s book, based mostly on the Venetian oral tradition, is our sole source for the well-known story of Polo’s involvement in the Battle of Korčula which led to his imprisonment in Genoa where he met Rustichello.</p>

<p>However, there is a mention of him in a chronicle written by another contemporary, Dominican friar Jacopo d’Acqui.  This chronicle, written during Polo’s life or very soon after, describes his involvement in the Battle of Layas (nowadays called Yumurtalık), which took place a few years earlier in 1294.  Henry Yule’s opinion on this is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This statement regarding the capture of Marco at the Battle of Ayas is one which cannot be true, for we know that he did not reach Venice till 1295. […] But though we cannot accept the statement that Polo was taken prisoner at Ayas, we may accept the passage as evidence from a contemporary source that he was <em>taken prisoner in some sea-fight with the Genoese</em>, and thus admit it in corroboration of the Ramusian Tradition of a sea-fight at Curzola in 1298, which is perfectly consistent with all other facts in our posession. [Introduction]<sup id="fnref:yule:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yule" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>d’Aqui’s report is also the origin of Polo’s famous deathbed quote that “he had not told one-half of what he had really seen.”</p>

<p>Another piece of evidence comes from Polo’s contemporary author, Padovan scholar Pietro d’Abano.  According to one of his books, he knew Polo personally and he talked to him about an astronomical observation (curiously, not included in Polo’s book), which wasn’t observed in Europe.</p>

<h3 id="was-he-really-in-china">
<a class="anchor" href="#was-he-really-in-china" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Was he really in China?</h3>

<p>When the various manuscripts started to be more thoroughly analyzed in the 19th century, the consensus was that Polo’s book, although highly exaggerated, was probably based on truth.  As the contact and the language exchange with China broadened, more and more places were identified with known cities and provinces, despite their names often changed beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Some scholars argued long ago that Polo didn’t undergo the journey to the south-west of China (marked in dotted line on the map below), due to the lack of details compared to his other journey along the Grand Canal.  Historians such as K. D. Hullmann, Herbert Franke, Craig Clunas, and Frances Wood have all researched this question.</p>

<p>However, the 1995 book by Dr. Frances Wood, <em>Did Marco Polo Go to China?</em>, caused quite a stir by claiming that Polo never went farther east than Constantinople and went as far as to claim that the whole persona of Marco Polo might be a fabrication.<sup id="fnref:wood" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wood" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The main arguments of Wood’s book are that most of the information could be found in contemporary Persian sources, that Polo is not mentioned in any Chinese sources, numerous inaccuracies in descriptions, and the fact that Polo omits some practices and structures which one would expect in a description of China, like the Great Wall, tea-drinking, calligraphy, foot-binding, or the usage of chopsticks, for instance.</p>

<p>One of the more glaring inconsistencies is the description of the Battle of Xiangyang, in which he mentions that he, along with his father and uncle, were present at the siege.  However, it is believed that the siege had already ended before Marco Polo’s arrival in China.  The book even claims that Polos overturn the battle by introducing Chinese to the concept of trebuchet, which is according to Chinese sources attributed to a family of Muslim engineers.<sup id="fnref:liang" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:liang" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Even in Venice, Wood argues, the story of the Polo family lacks sufficient corroboration.  There were several Polo families and Marco was a popular name.  There’s a Polo will of the right date but it mentions nothing about China or any travels into the Orient, nor that he bequeaths anything unique to his daughters.  The depiction of Peter as a “Tartar” doesn’t necessarily imply that Marco Polo brought Peter from his travels in the Far East as Tatar servants were a commonplace at that time.</p>

<p>“As we don’t have the ‘original’ manuscript, all speculation as to how the text was compiled is just speculation,” Wood says. “Rustichello could have compiled travelers’ tales and existing texts but his involvement may also be a fabrication – we are talking about a time when the idea of authorship and copyright simply didn’t exist.”</p>

<p>Her strongest argument, however, is the total absence of his name in Chinese sources.</p>

<p>The <em>History of Yuan</em> mentions a certain Boluo, an adversary of Khan, being arrested in 1274.  The accusation was that Boluo had walked on the same side of the road as a female courtesan, in contravention of the order for men and women to walk on opposite sides of the road inside the city.  This Boluo was said to be a governor and superintendent of salt production in Yangzhou, but it was found out that it refers to a Mongol named Poulad in Persian sources and Bolad Akha in Mongol, not Marco Polo.</p>

<p>Francis Woodman Cleaves noted in 1970s that Polo’s account of the voyage of the princess Kököchin from China to Persia to marry the Īl-khān in 1293 has been confirmed by a passage in the 15th century Chinese work Yongle Encyclopedia, and by the Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in his Jami’ al-tawarikh.</p>

<p>However, neither of these accounts mentions Polo or indeed any European as part of the bridal party, although the Yongle Encyclopedia confirms the names of three convoys, Oulatai, Apusca, and Coja, mentioned by Polo.<sup id="fnref:cleaves" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cleaves" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="maybe">
<a class="anchor" href="#maybe" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>…maybe!</h3>

<p>Nonetheless, most of the historians specializing in East Asia history criticized Wood’s work quite harshly.  Several authors pointed out poor scholarship, blatant errors, and argued against most of the points that were brought up.</p>

<p>For example, the Great Wall of China, while certainly already there, was far less impressive than the structure we know today, built several centuries after Polo’s visit.  Moreover, other European visitors to China during the Yuan dynasty, such as Giovanni de’ Marignolli, or Odoric of Pordenone, said nothing about the wall either.  Another 13th-century Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta, who asked about the wall when he visited China shortly after Marco, could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it.</p>

<p>Foot-binding was mentioned by Odoric, but no other travelers.  Also, tea-drinking wasn’t actually mentioned in European literature until Ramusio’s aforementioned <em>Navigations and Travels</em> from 1550.  Also, while Polo mentions wine and other drinks, his omission of tea could be intentional, similarly to his description of Xichang in which he mentions a plethora of spices, but then adds that there are “other spices which never reach our countries, so we need say nothing about them”.</p>

<p>A much more compelling argument of Wood’s book is the number of errors and inaccuracies in Polo’s description of e.g. Marco Polo Bridge, the city wall of Khanbaliq, and descriptions of Chinese ships.  However, his accounts do describe some Chinese nautical inventions which until then weren’t mentioned in European sources such as the watertight compartments or bulkhead partitions.</p>

<p>An important fact to consider is that Polos spent most of their time with the Mongols, and Chinese culture might not be that apparent under the yoke.  It is very unlikely that he would learn the Chinese language, for example.</p>

<p>In a 2012 study, German sinologist Hans Ulrich Vogel argues that the descriptions of currencies, salt production sites, and revenues were unprecedented in its time.  Not only does he detail the shape and size of the paper, but he also describes the use of seals and the various denominations of paper money.<sup id="fnref:vogel" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vogel" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Wood accused Polo of confusing cowry money with Chinese ceramic-porcelain, but Vogel argues that Polo’s description was unique because he was the only writer to mention the use of the cowry as a currency in Yunnan during the Yuan.  Not only was Polo the sole non-Chinese author to mention this, but he also accurately pointed out that the cowries were not local, but imported from India.<sup id="fnref:vogel2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vogel2" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Most of the scholars, however, do agree that accounts of Polo’s travels and importance in China are full of inaccuracies, exaggerations, and, possibly, lies.  Nonetheless, some of Polo’s descriptions of the Chinese people and their country were remarkably accurate for its time.</p>

<h3 id="here-be-dragons">
<a class="anchor" href="#here-be-dragons" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Here be dragons</h3>

<p>In comparison to other contemporary reports from the Far East, Polo’s accounts are relatively sober when it comes to fantastical elements.  It even dispels some of the earlier myths, like the old Persian belief that asbestos is made from the hide of an animal called <em>samandar</em> (which by extension led to the myth that salamanders can withstand fire).  Polo instead says that it is “a substance found in the earth”. [Book I, Chapter 42]<sup id="fnref:yule:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yule" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The description of the ‘unicorn’ can be safely identified with Sumatran rhinoceros. [Book III, Chapter 9]<sup id="fnref:yule:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yule" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>However, some stories continue to raise questions, such as his description of a two-legged ‘dragon’ in Southeast China.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are found snakes and huge serpents, ten paces in length and ten spans in girth [15m, 240 cm]. At the fore part, near the head, they have two short legs, each with three claws, as well as eyes larger than a loaf and very glaring. The jaws are wide enough to swallow a man, the teeth are large and sharp, and their whole appearance is so formidable that neither man, nor any kind of animal can approach them without terror. Others are of smaller size, being eight, six, or five paces long. [Book II, Chapter 49]<sup id="fnref:yule:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yule" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

</figure>

<p>But we should note that dragons of various shapes and proportions were already featured in various legends and bestiaries of the time. <sup id="fnref:dragons" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dragons" class="footnote">7</a></sup>  Just as the stories about the dog-headed people. which Polo connected with the Andaman Islands.  A very similar description of these dog-headed barbarians is featured in the legend of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Alexander">Gates of Alexander</a>, which the book cites on several other occasions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Angamanain is a very large Island. The people are without a king and are Idolaters, and no better than wild beasts. And I assure you all the men of this Island of Angamanain have heads like dogs, and teeth and eyes likewise; in fact, in the face they are all just like big mastiff dogs! They have a quantity of spices; but they are a most cruel generation, and eat everybody that they can catch, if not of their own race.  They live on flesh and rice and milk, and have fruits different from any of ours. [Book III, Chapter 13]<sup id="fnref:yule:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yule" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Ibn Battuta, reported the people “whose mouths are like those of dogs” in roughly the same area as Polo - on islands between India and Sumatra.  This led to speculations that these descriptions refer to indigenous tribes such as Mentawai people who practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_tooth_sharpening">teeth-sharpening</a> to this day.  Here’s Battuta’s report for a comparison:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fifteen days after leaving Sunaridwan we reached the country of the Barahnakar, whose mouths are like those of dogs. This tribe is a rabble, professing neither the religion of the Hindus nor any other. […] Their men are shaped like ourselves, except that their mouths are shaped like those of dogs; this is not the case with their womenfolk, however, who are endowed with surpassing beauty.<sup id="fnref:battuta" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:battuta" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
  <img src="/i/Marco/dogheads.jpg" alt="ditto">
  <em>ditto </em>
</figure>

<p>Polo mentions yet another mythical creature in his description of Madagascar - an enormous bird from Persian legends called Rukh.  However, although this book is likely the first to mention this island in European or Asian literature, most of it is quite wrong, and the book makes it clear that the stories about it are based on secondhand accounts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For persons who had been there and had seen it told Messer Marco Polo that it was for all the world like an eagle, but one indeed of enormous size; so big in fact that its wings covered an extent of 30 paces [23 m], and its quills were 12 paces long, and thick in proportion. And it is so strong that it will seize an elephant in its talons and carry him high into the air, and drop him so that he is smashed to pieces. [Book III, Chapter 33]<sup id="fnref:yule:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yule" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="alaskan-coastline">
<a class="anchor" href="#alaskan-coastline" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alaskan coastline</h3>

<p>In 1887, a set of 14 parchments were brought to America by an Italian teenaged immigrant named Marcian Rossi, who claimed that Marco Polo entrusted them to one of his ancestors.  The parchments include stories written by one of Marco’s daughters, Bella and Fantina, and most importantly a crudely drawn map that seems to depict the Alaskan coastline.</p>

<p>It also notes that they came across “people who speak the Tartar language, and […] go about dressed in sealskins, living on fish.”<sup id="fnref:alaska" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:alaska" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Rossi donated this parchment, named <em>Map with Ship</em>, to the Library of Congress in the 1930s, which even caught the attention of FBI’s J. Edgar Hoover who prompted further investigation.</p>

<p>A thorough study of all 14 documents was published in 2014 by a historian of cartography Benjamin B. Olshin.  Olshin has been researching these documents for 13 years and he was the first scholar to fully decode and translate the maps and to trace Rossi’s ancestry to Venice.<sup id="fnref:olshin" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:olshin" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Olshin himself notes that there are many questions about the authenticity of these documents.  The inscriptions, written in Italian, Latin, Arabic, and even Chinese suggest that it must have been made by someone knowledgeable in languages and cartography.</p>

<p>On the other hand recent radiocarbon dating of this parchment revealed that it dates to the 15th or 16th centuries, meaning that it is a later copy of the original or at worst a forgery.<sup id="fnref:hessler" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hessler" class="footnote">11</a></sup>  The other parchments mention and depict the New World and travelers like Cortez and Columbus. <sup id="fnref:myoldmaps" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:myoldmaps" class="footnote">12</a></sup>  Those mentions are not out-of-place for the time they’re dated to, but the shape of the Alaskan coast, and the strait separating it from Asia wasn’t mapped until the 18th-century voyages of Vitus Bering.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#reconstructing-the-route" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reconstructing the route</h2>

<p>Because the book is written more like an itinerary rather than a journal, it rarely explicitly states whether Polo actually visited the places it mentions.  Tracing the path between the cities in the order they’re mentioned quickly reveals that such a route would be highly impractical.  That suggests that a lot of stuff is compiled from previous sources, especially the description of Persian provinces, regions of today’s Mongolia, and inner China.</p>

<p>As there are around 150 manuscripts in different languages and none of them can be considered the original, many Chinese and Mongol names were changed beyond recognition.  However, most of the place names correspond to their modern renditions remarkably well.  Like <em>Taianfu (=Taiyuan)</em>, <em>Chinginju (=Changzhou)</em>, <em>Yanju (=Yangzhou)</em>, <em>Saianfu (=Xiangyang)</em>, <em>Linju (=Linyi)</em>, <em>Yachi (=Yuxi)</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Some scholars, most notably famous 19th-century orientalist and geographer Henry Yule and more recently Amelia Carolina Sparavigna of the Polytechnic University of Turin, attempted to identify all places and even reconstruct the most likely path which Polo took based on historical roads and other contemporary itineraries.  Today, the absolute majority of names have been identified, but some are still a subject of controversy.</p>
