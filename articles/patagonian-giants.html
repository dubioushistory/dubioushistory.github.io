</ul><p>Most countries and civilizations have stories about giants in their mythology or folklore.  The reports of their size greatly vary and characteristics range from vicious man-eating beasts to superior demigods.  But few of them have such a plethora of first-hand accounts in the historical literature as the Patagonia region and specifically the areas around the Strait of Magellan during the Age of Sail.</p>

<h3 id="16th-century">
<a class="anchor" href="#16th-century" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>16th century</h3>

<p>The story usually starts with the 1519–22 expedition of Portuguese explorer Fernão de Magalhães better known as Magellan.  Out of more than 200 people who set sail, only 18 returned to tell the tale (Magellan himself died during the travels in 1521).  One of the men who returned was Antonio Pigafetta, whose records are our main source for the history of the expedition.</p>

<p>Regarding his accounts, none raised as much controversy as his description of giant inhabitants they encountered in Saint Julian inlet in today’s Argentina.  He immortalized them as the gigantic “Patagons” in his 1525 book, <em>Report on the First Voyage around the World</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We remained in that land for 13 days.  The proceeding on our way, we went as far as 34 and one-third degrees toward the Antarctic Pole, where we found people at a freshwater river, called Canibali, who eat human flesh.  One of them, in stature almost a giant, came to the flag-ship in order to assure [the safety of] the others, his friends.  He had a voice like a bull.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Few paragraphs after, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leaving that place, we finally reached 49 and one-half degree toward the Antarctic Pole. […] One day we suddenly saw a naked man of giant stature on the shore of the port, dancing, singing, and throwing dust on his head.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the giant was in the captain-general’s and our presence, he marveled greatly, and made signs with one finger raised upward, believing that we had come from the sky. He was so tall that we reached only to his waist, and he was well proportioned.  His face was large and painted red all over, while about his eyes he was painted yellow; and he had two hearts painted on the middle of his cheeks. His scanty hair was painted white. He was dressed in the skins of animals skilfully sewn together.<sup id="fnref:pigafetta" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pigafetta" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following pages describe many other encounters with various giants.  Magellan’s crew even captured two of them to bring back to Spain, but they became ill and died on the journey.</p>

<p>Pigafetta doesn’t provide a concrete estimate of their height, but another contemporary document does.  Three years before Pigafetta’s journal seen print, Maximillianus Transylvanus, the son of the Archbishop of Salzburg, interviewed three surviving members of the expedition.<sup id="fnref:transylvanus" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:transylvanus" class="footnote">2</a></sup>  The English translation, which can be found in <em>The Philippine Islands, Vol. 1</em> by Blair, Bourne &amp; Robinson, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These Indians were very tall, ten spans high [2.3 m, 7 ft. 7 in.], clad in skins of wild beasts, darker-complexioned than would have been expected in that part of the world.<sup id="fnref:blair" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:blair" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Transylvanius’ number doesn’t seem too extraordinary from today’s perspective, Magellan’s expedition fixed Patagonia in the minds of Europeans as the <em>regio gigantum</em> and soon, maps of the region featured illustrations of people nearly twice as tall as the explorers greeting them.</p>

  <em>Regio Gigantum from a 1562 map by Diego Gutiérrez </em>
</figure>

<p>It would be easy to dismiss the accounts of giants as a tall tale (<em>sorry</em>), except that amount of reports had been only growing over time…  Starting with a brief mention from a Spanish expedition of García Jofre de Loaísa in 1525, which proposes astounding thirteen spans tall Patagonians [3 m, 10 ft.].<sup id="fnref:becco" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:becco" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>One hundred years after Magellan, a detailed account of the voyages of Francis Drake was published by his nephew (of the same name).  Apparently not very fond of the “Spaniards’” stories, he reported about the Patagonians:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Magellane was not altogether deceived, in naming them Giants; for they generally differ from the common sort of men, both in stature, bignes, and strength of body, as also in the hideousness of their voice: but yet they are nothing so monstrous, or giant like as they were reported; there being some English men, as tall, as the highest of any that we could see, peradventure the Spaniards did not thinke that ever any English man would come thither to reprove them, and thereupon might presume to boldly lie; the name <em>Pentagones</em>, <em>Five cubits</em>, viz., 7 foote and halfe [2.3 m], describing the full height (if not somewhat more) of the highest of them.<sup id="fnref:drake" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:drake" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before the actual encounter happened, the book also mentions footprints whose “breadth was the length of one of our men’s feet of the largest size, which could be no other than the foot of a giant, so that we conjectured that the giants did possess some part of Brasilia on the north side of the river Plate.” [today’s Uruguay]</p>

<p>Another member of the Francis Drake’s crew and his cousin, John Drake, was later captured by the Spanish and sent for the inquisition to provide a detailed account of the expedition.  In its transcript, Drake confirms a skirmish with the giants in Saint Julian that resulted in the death of one native and two sailors.<sup id="fnref:inquisition" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inquisition" class="footnote">6</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:inquisition2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inquisition2" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Apparently troubled by Drake’s raids, the Viceroy of Perú sent Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa to secure the Strait of Magellan in 1579 to prevent the English from settling it first.  Throughout the book, he refers to various natives as giants.  And although not estimating the height, he says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ten men, who had got out of the boat, attacked one of the natives and were scarcely able to hold him.<sup id="fnref:sarmiento" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sarmiento" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, they managed to kidnap one of the natives while being showered by arrows from his companions.  According to a footnote in an 1895 English translation, this giant was later brought to Spanish king Phillip II.</p>

<p>The last English expedition of the century to the Americas was led by Thomas Cavendish.  He reached the Strait of Magellan in 1587.  The first published report from this expedition says that they found footmarks “of a gigantic race, as the measure of one of their footmarks was eighteen inches [45,7 cm] long”.<sup id="fnref:cavendish" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cavendish" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The height was specified by Anthonie Knivet, an adventurer who had sailed with Cavendish.  Apart from estimating the height based on said footmarks, he mentions a freshly buried body:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Giants fifteeene or sixteene spans of height. I affirme, that at Port Desire I saw the footing of them, by the shoare side, that was aboute foure foote of one of our mens in length; and I saw two of them that were buried newly, the one of them was fourteene spannes long.<sup id="fnref:knivet" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:knivet" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right before the turn of the century, two captains of the Dutch East Indies company reported about giants.  Sebald de Veert describes being attacked by “savages whom he thought to be ten or eleven feet high.”<sup id="fnref:veert" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:veert" class="footnote">11</a></sup>  In the same year, Oliver Van Noort, had a <em>recontre</em> with this gigantic race, whom he represents to be of high stature and of a terrible aspect.  It’s not clear whether these two accounts describe the same event.</p>

<p>More interestingly, Noort seems to be the first one to note that not all tribes were this tall.  He specifically names a tribe “called <em>Tirimenen</em>, dwelling in <em>Coin</em>, which was of a gigantic stature, being ten or twelve feet high and continually at war with the other tribes”.  He describes all the other tribes as being of average height. <sup id="fnref:noort" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:noort" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="17th-century">
<a class="anchor" href="#17th-century" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>17th century</h3>

<p>Most of the sources from the 17th century don’t provide much factual information on giants, besides calling the natives “gigantic people”, “savages of a gigantic stature”, etc.  It should be noted, that some explorers who sailed through the Strait didn’t encounter these giants whatsoever or encountered people of ordinary height. (See the table below.)</p>

<p>Notable exceptions are the first reports of skeletons from the expedition of Willem Corneliszoon Schouten: “graves with skeletons of very human beings, with bones 10 to 11 feet.”<sup id="fnref:schouten" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:schouten" class="footnote">13</a></sup> and Hendrick Brouwer’s mention of “footsteps of men that measured eighteen inches [45.7m].”<sup id="fnref:brouwer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:brouwer" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="18th-century">
<a class="anchor" href="#18th-century" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>18th century</h3>

<p>French explorer Amédée-François Frézier, evidently fascinated by the stories of giants, wrote in 1714 that Don Pedro Molina and some other eye-witnesses told him about a tribe called <em>Caucahues</em> which averaged to about nine or ten foot high.<sup id="fnref:frezier" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:frezier" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Around 1764 a ship commanded by Commodore John Byron (grandfather of the famous poet) had a friendly encounter with a tribe of giants on Patagonia shore.  He estimated their height to be from eight to nine feet.<sup id="fnref:byron" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:byron" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<p>Similar to Noort and Frézier, he also emphasizes that there are several different tribes in the region, not all of them being this tall.<sup id="fnref:fitzroy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fitzroy" class="footnote">17</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1767, Captain Samuel Wallis, apparently fed up with the conflicting reports about giants, sailed to Patagonia with a measuring rod.  There he measured some very tall people, for sure, but not giants.  The tallest man he measured was 6 feet 7 inches [2 m], with several others only an inch or two shorter.  But, he reported, most were between 5 feet 10 inches and six feet tall [~1.8 m].<sup id="fnref:wallis" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wallis" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>

<p>Jesuit Thomas Falkner, who spent almost 40 years among the southern tribes, mentions a <em>Tehuelche</em> chief “seven feet and some inches tall” [over 2.1 m] in his 1774 book.  He also notes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Patagonians, or <em>Puelches</em>, are a large bodied people ; but I have never heard of that gigantic race, which others have mentioned, though I have seen persons of all the different tribes of southern Indians.<sup id="fnref:falkner" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:falkner" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that basically marks the end of the era of giants.  Following records from the 18th and 19th centuries all focus specifically on <em>Aónikenk</em> (<em>Tehuelche</em>) people and no measures exceed 2 meters.  There are no other mentions of <em>Caucahue</em> or <em>Tirimenen</em> people in other literature.</p>

<p>Today, we know that <a href="https://doorofperception.com/2016/10/the-lost-tribes-of-tierra-del-fuego/">there were many extraordinary tribes</a> in this part of the World which completely eradicated from history by diseases and genocides by European colonizers.  If any tribes of giants ever existed, they are among the victims.</p>
