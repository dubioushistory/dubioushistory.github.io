</ul><p>The theory of Phoenician discovery of the America suggests that the earliest Old World contact with the Americas was not with Columbus or even Norse settlers, but with the Phoenicians (or, alternatively, other Semitic peoples).</p>

<p>There’s no wonder that there’s so many controversies surrounding this engimatic people, which we still know little about, ranging from the extent of their sea travels to their religion and alleged child sacrifices.  Ironically, though their alphabet became one of the most widely used writing system in the West, very few Phoenician manuscripts have survived in the original or in translation due either to their destruction during Macedonian and Roman aggression or for having been written on perishable material.</p>

<p>This particual theory fell quickly into the fringe territory because quite a few artifacts speaking in it’s favor are now considered to be forgeries.  However, there are still people who vehemently support it.</p>

<h3 id="the-paraíba-inscription">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-para%C3%ADba-inscription" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Paraíba Inscription</h3>

<p>In 1872, National Museum of Brazil received a letter signed by a man named Joaquim Alves da Costa, which contained transcription of the inscriptions found on a stone at “<em>Pouso-Alto on the shores of the Parahyba</em>”.</p>

<p>The director of the museum Ladislau de souza Mello Netto first accepted the inscription as geniune, but by 1873, philologist Ernest Renan convinced him that it was a forgery.  According to his translation the inscription tells story of “Sidonian Canaanites”, who set sail around Africa and wound up on the shores of Brazil during the nineteenth year of the reign of King Hiram, some 500 years BC.<sup id="fnref:netto" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:netto" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<figure>
  <img src="/i/Phoenicians/paraiba.jpg" alt="Inscriptions sent along with the letter.">
  <em>Inscriptions sent along with the letter. </em>
</figure>

<p>Netto also reports that all efforts of locating the original autor of the inscription were in vain, which led him to believe that it was a hoax.  The skeptical website <a href="http://www.badarchaeology.com/out-of-place-artefacts/petroglyphs-inscriptions-and-reliefs/the-paraiba-parahyba-stone/">BadArcheology.com</a> claims that there was a real person Joachim Alves da Costa Freitas, who lived close to Pouso Alto in Minas Gerais province during the 1870s.  Sadly, the link seemingly proving this leads to now-defunct Yahoo Groups and it doesn’t seem to be archived anywhere.  If you know how to verify such information in some official records, please <a href="/contact">let us know!</a></p>

<p>The hypothesis was brought up again in 1967 by Cyrus Herzel Gordon, expert in Semitic languages and head of the Department of Mediterranean Studies at Brandeis University, well-known for his translations of the ancient Cretan “Linear A”.  He provided a slighly different translation and concluded that “it is obvious that the text is genuine, since it didn’t copy any Semitic writing that would have been widely accessible at the time.”<sup id="fnref:gordon" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gordon" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Another contemporary expert on semitic languages, Frank Moore Cross, disagreed, supporting Renan’s opinion that the letter forms cover a range of ten centuries and that they could be made with knowledge of that time (see e.g. Jordan Moabite Stone from 1870<sup id="fnref:boloji" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:boloji" class="footnote">3</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Here is Dr. Gordon’s translation of the text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are Sidonian Canaanites from the city of the Mercantile King. We were cast up on this distant shore, a land of mountains. We sacrificed a youth to the celestial gods and goddesses in the nineteenth year of our mighty King Hiram and embarked from Ezion-geber into the Red Sea. We voyaged with ten ships and were at sea together for two years around Africa [Ham]. Then we were separated by the hand of Baal and were no longer with our companions. So we have come here, twelve men and three women, into New Shore. Am I, the Admiral, a man who would flee? Nay! May the celestial gods and goddesses favour us well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s conclude with a wonderful summary from Austin Whittall on his Patagonian Monsters blog: “So, we have a letter with a transcription of inscriptions found on a stone, that was never actually seen by scientists, it was posted from an unknown place on an ambiguous river by a person who could not be found later. It’s text was, according to some scholars badly written and therefore a hoax, but, according to others, genuine.”<sup id="fnref:whittall" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:whittall" class="footnote">4</a></sup>  Make of that what you will.</p>

<h3 id="bat-creek-inscription">
<a class="anchor" href="#bat-creek-inscription" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bat Creek inscription</h3>

<p>The Bat Creek stone is an inscribed stone collected as part of a Native American burial mound excavation in Loudon County, Tennessee, in 1889.</p>

<p>The inscriptions were initially described as Cherokee, but Gordon correctly identified them as Hebrew.</p>

<p>However in 2004, similarities to an inscription that was circulating in a Freemason book were discovered by Robert C. Mainfort and Mary L. Kwas indicating that it’s religiously motivated nineteenth century forgery.<sup id="fnref:kwas" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kwas" class="footnote">5</a></sup>  The inscription in question, an 1860s artist’s impression of how the Biblical phrase QDSh LYHWH, or “Holy to Yahweh,” would have looked in Paleo-Hebrew letters, is reproduced below along with the Bat Creek stone itself:</p>

<h3 id="los-lunas-decalogue-stone">
<a class="anchor" href="#los-lunas-decalogue-stone" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Los Lunas Decalogue Stone</h3>

<p>This inscribed stone is located on a 400 foot high mesa in Hidden Mountain, near Los Lunas, New Mexico.  It is written in Paleo-Hebrew using north Canaanite script of the early first millenium BC and it appears to be a version of Decalogue (better known as Ten Commandments).</p>

<p>Since the stone’s discovery in the 1930s, several different translations were proposed.  But it was translation of Robert Pfeiffer of Harvard’s Semitic Museum from 1949 that created the greatest interest among scholars and others.</p>

<p>Many ascribe the first mention of the stone in print to the late Prof. Frank C. Hibben, archeologist from University of Mexio, in 1933, though no record exists of his having published anything on the subject.  It was first reported by Prof. James D. Tabor of the Dept. of Religious Studies, University of North Carolina - Charlotte, who interviewed Hibben in 1996.<sup id="fnref:tabor" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:tabor" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Hibben reports that he first saw the text in 1933. At the time it was covered with lichen and patination and was hardly visible. He was taken to the site by a guide who had seen it as a boy, back in the 1880s.”  Hibben’s assessment of its age in the 1930s, based on the growth of mosses and lichens on it, was that the incised characters were at least a hundred years old.</p>

<p>The stone is blanched (from being cleaned by Boy Scouts in the 1950s, Hibben told Tabor), making dating through the patina, the surface layer of the rock, impossible. The first line has been scratched out by a vandal in 2006, but the rest of the inscription is completely legible.</p>

<p>David Atlee Phillips, curator of Archeology at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology and professor of anthropology at the University of New Mexico, finds it much more likely that the inscription is the work of con artists than evidence of an ancient civilization. The smoking gun for Phillips is the “caret”, the upside-down V symbol placed under a piece of text where something has been missed out.  Sometimes found in ancient Latin and Greek texts, it is not known in Hebrew until the Middle Ages.  To make matters worse, it is above a dot that seems to be a full stop (or period); full stops did not exist in ancient Hebrew. Moreover, there are Greek letters of a slightly later date mixed in with Hebrew forms.<sup>[<a href="/contact">citation needed</a>]</sup></p>

<p>In any case, even before 1880, and certainly before 1933 when Hibben first described the stone, enough had been learned about Paleo-Hebrew to account for a contemporary forgery.  See e.g. <em>A Discourse Concerning Sanchoniathon’s Phoenician History</em> by Henry Dodwell from 1691.</p>

<p>Also, let’s not discount the presence of refugee Jews in the earliest waves of Spanish colonists and settlers in the 16th or 17th century.  Today’s New Mexico one of the farthest outposts in the empire of New Spain. It was an excellent place to avoid the horrors of the Inquisition.</p>

<h3 id="baal-stone">
<a class="anchor" href="#baal-stone" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Baal Stone</h3>

<p>The triangular stone, first documented by archaeologist James P. Whittall II, was popularized in book <em>America B.C.</em> by Barry Fell.  According to Fell, the inscription is in Iberian Punic script and says “To Baal of the Canaanites, this in Dedication”.<sup id="fnref:fell" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fell" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>It was found on a site called America’s Stonehenge in Salem, New Hampshire, previously called Mystery Hill by its owner William Goodwin who believed it was built by Culdee monks from Ireland.  The place was later sold to Bob Stone whose son still owns the site and the stone.</p>

<p><em>Side-note:</em> One of the photos circulating the internet which apparently shows the artifact is definitely a replica.  Although the inscriptions are more or less equal to the ones depicted in Fell’s book, it’s clearly a different stone.</p>

<p>Another claim was presented (relatively) recently at History Channel TV show <em>America Unearthed</em> by Scott Wolter and son of current owner of the site.  They hint at the posibility of Phoenician link with the site by showing that Summer Solstice sunrise alignment of American’s stonehenge can be extended all the way to the Stonehenge and continues straight into city of Beirut, Lebanon.<sup id="fnref:stonehenge" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stonehenge" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Apart from referring to Lebanon as “ancient home of the ancient Phoenicians”, they don’t explain what’s the connection with England’s Stonehenge.  They also fail to mention that while the place we call Beirut today was most likely settled, it doesn’t seem to play any big role in historical records compared to cities like Byblos or Sidon.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the summer solstice sunrise alignment of America’s stonehenge does point roughly in the direction of Stonehenge, but remember that the exact course of this line is obviously very sensitive on the initial degree.  Lines which start pretty much parallel can diverge by several kilometers by the time they reach England.</p>

<p><em>Another side-note:</em> Just few days before finishing this article, a QAnon supporter allegedly vandalized the megalithic monument with infamous WWG1WGA slogan and his twitter handle.<sup id="fnref:qanon" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:qanon" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Plymouth State University archaeologist David Starbuck notes the 19th century quarrying marks on many of the stones and said the site has been altered so many times over the decades—particularly by owner and researcher William Goodwin starting in 1936—that there will never be a way to settle the argument over its genesis.<sup id="fnref:starbuck" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:starbuck" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="sherbrooke-stones">
<a class="anchor" href="#sherbrooke-stones" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sherbrooke stones</h3>

<p>According to 1975 newspaper article, A Laval University Prof. Thomas Lee found three stones in Quebec province’s Eastern Townships which could indicate that North America was visited by North Africans 500 years before the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>Prof. Thomas Lee said the stones were discovered “sometime early in this century” but the Egyptian inscriptions were written in a Libyan script not deciphered until last year.  He said the earliest mention of the stones he has seen is in a letter dated Dec. 26, 1910, but he “got the impression the stones were not in the museum at that time.” A spokesman for the museum said it has had the stones since at least 1910.</p>

<p>He said one stone is inscribed: “Expedition that crossed in the service of Lord Hiram to conquer territory.” The other of the pair discovered together bears the inscription: “Record by Hata, who attained this limit on the river, moored his ship and engraved this rock.”  The stone which was found alone reads: “Hanno, son of Tamu, reached this mountain landmark.”,<sup id="fnref:winnipeg" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:winnipeg" class="footnote">11</a></sup>  Probably alluding to famous Hanno the Navigator himself.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#diodoros-of-sicily" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Diodoros of Sicily</h3>

<p>Diodoros’ <em>Library of History</em> is remarkable for many reasons. This 40-volume book (of which only 15 books survive intact) is considered one of the earliest attempts at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_history">Universal history</a> and also it is notably more detached from ‘Hellenocentric’ world-view<sup id="fnref:usher" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:usher" class="footnote">12</a></sup>.  It’s also a major source of our knowledge about Alexander the Great!</p>

<p>That being said, some passages are a bit controversial.  For fans of Alternative History, he’s mainly notable for his mentions of Atlanteans, but it also contains this peculiar passage story about Phoenicians:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now that we have discussed what relates to the islands which lie within the Pillars of Hercules, we shall give an account of those which are in the ocean. For there lies out in the deep off Libya an island of considerable size, and situated as it is in the ocean it is distant from Libya a voyage of a number of days to the west.  Its land is fruitful, much of it being mountainous and not a little being a level plain of surpassing beauty. Through it flow navigable rivers which are used for irrigation, and the island contains many parks planted with trees of every variety and gardens in great multitudes which are traversed by streams of sweet water;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>on it also are private villas of costly construction, and throughout the gardens banqueting houses have been constructed in a setting of flowers, and in them the inhabitants pass their time during the summer season, since the land supplies in abundance everything which contributes to enjoyment and luxury.  […] the climate of this island is so altogether mild that it produces in abundance the fruits of the trees and the other seasonal fruits for the larger part of the year, so that it would appear that the island, because of its exceptional felicity, were a dwelling-place of a race of gods and not of men.(V-19)<sup id="fnref:diodoros" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diodoros" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In ancient times this island remained undiscovered because of its distance from the entire inhabited world j but it was discovered at a later period for the following reason.  The Phoenicians, who from ancient times on made voyages continually for purposes of trade, planted many colonies throughout Libya and not a few as well in the western parts of Europe.  And since their ventures turned out according to their expectations, they amassed great wealth and essayed to voyage beyond the Pillars of Heracles into the sea which men call the ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] The Phoenicians, then, while exploring the coast outside the Pillars for the reasons we have stated and while sailing along the shore of Libya, were driven by strong winds a great distance out into the ocean. And after being storm-tossed for many days they were carried ashore on the island we mentioned above, and when they had observed its felicity and nature they caused it to be known to all men.(V-20)<sup id="fnref:diodoros:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diodoros" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we are said that Tyrrhenians wanted to make a colony there, but Carthaginians prevented it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] partly out of concern lest many inhabitants of Carthage should remove there because of the excellence of the island, and partly in order to have ready in it a place in which to seek refuge against an incalculable turn of fortune, in case some total disaster should overtake Carthage.  For it was their thought that, since they were masters of the sea, they would thus be able to move, households and all, to an island which was unknown to their conquerors.</p>
