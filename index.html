<h1>Welcome to Dubious History<sup>[1]</sup></h1>

<p>This website is dedicated to people who are interested in the mystery of ancient human history and don't feel really persuaded by the general consensus on the topic in academic circles.</p>

<p>The goal of this website is not to disprove <strong>or</strong> prove any Alternative History theories.  Instead, the focus is on gathering all relevant resources needed for a reader to form his own opinion with as least bias as possible.</p>
